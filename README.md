#### Background
Chronic active lesions (CAL) in multiple sclerosis (MS) have been observed even in patients taking high-efficacy disease-modifying therapy, including B-cell depletion. Given that CAL are a major determinant of clinical progression, including progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA), understanding the predicted activity and real-world effects of targeting specific lymphocyte populations is critical for designing next-generation treatments to mitigate chronic inflammation in MS.
#### Methods
We analyzed published lymphocyte single-cell transcriptomes from MS lesions and bioinformatically predicted the effects of depleting lymphocyte subpopulations (including CD20 B-cells) from CAL via gene-regulatory-network machine-learning analysis. Motivated by the results, we performed in vivo MRI assessment of PRL changes in 72 adults with MS, 46 treated with anti-CD20 antibodies and 26 untreated, over ~2 years.
#### Findings
Although only 4.3% of lymphocytes in CAL were CD20 B-cells, their depletion is predicted to affect microglial genes involved in iron/heme metabolism, hypoxia, and antigen presentation. In vivo, tracking 202 PRL (150 treated) and 175 non-PRL (124 treated), none of the treated paramagnetic rims disappeared at follow-up, nor was there a treatment effect on PRL for lesion volume, magnetic susceptibility, or T1 time. PIRA occurred in 20% of treated patients, more frequently in those with ≥4 PRL (p=0.027).
#### Interpretation
Despite predicted effects on microglia-mediated inflammatory networks in CAL and iron metabolism, anti-CD20 therapies do not fully resolve PRL after 2-year MRI follow up. Limited tissue turnover of B-cells, inefficient passage of anti-CD20 antibodies across the blood-brain-barrier, and a paucity of B-cells in CAL could explain our findings.
